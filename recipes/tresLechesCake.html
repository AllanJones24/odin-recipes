    <p>
      Delight your taste buds with the decadent and moist Tres Leches Cake. This
      Latin American-inspired dessert is a heavenly confection that bathes a
      light sponge cake in a trio of milks – evaporated milk, sweetened
      condensed milk, and whole milk. The result is a luscious,
      melt-in-your-mouth experience that perfectly balances sweetness and
      richness, making it a delightful treat for any celebration.

      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>5 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a baking pan.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, whisk together flour and baking powder. Set aside.</li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the flour mixture, mixing until just combined.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes or
        until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the cake is baking, mix together whole milk, sweetened condensed
        milk, and evaporated milk in a separate bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the cake is done and while it's still warm, poke holes in it with a
        fork or skewer.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the milk mixture over the cake, allowing it to soak in.</li>
      <li>
        Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before serving, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form, and spread
        it over the chilled cake.
